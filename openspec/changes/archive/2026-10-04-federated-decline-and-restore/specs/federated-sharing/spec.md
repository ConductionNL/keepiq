## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Remote copies are read-only

Read-only covers the value and the sharing, not where the recipient files the copy. The system MUST refuse, for its owner, any change of a read-only secret's value, login, additional fields, name, URL or type, a sync, onward sharing and link-share creation. The system MUST allow a change of only its folder. When the recipient declines a pending share, or moves an accepted copy to the trash or deletes it for good, the receiving server MUST mark the inbound share declined and send OCM `SHARE_DECLINED` to the owner's instance. The owner's share MUST then show as declined, and the sending server MUST NOT serve it or send further notifications for it. When the recipient restores a copy whose share they declined by deleting it, the receiving server MUST send OCM `SHARE_ACCEPTED` to the owner's instance. When the owner's instance takes it, the inbound share MUST be accepted again, the owner's share MUST be live again, and the copy MUST pull the current value. When the owner revoked the share, removed it, or shared the secret with the recipient again in the meantime, the copy MUST stay read-only with its last value, the restore MUST say that the share has ended, and the system MUST NOT give the recipient any access the owner did not grant.

#### Scenario: Bob cannot edit or pass it on

- **GIVEN** a read-only federated copy in Bob's vault
- **WHEN** Bob calls `PUT /api/v1/secrets/{id}` with a new name, value, login or fields, or tries to share it
- **THEN** the system MUST refuse the request with a forbidden response

#### Scenario: Bob files his copy in a folder

- **GIVEN** a read-only federated copy in Bob's vault and a folder of Bob's
- **WHEN** Bob moves the copy to that folder
- **THEN** the system MUST store the new folder and leave the value, name and sharing as the owner sent them

#### Scenario: Bob deletes his copy

- **GIVEN** a federated share accepted by Bob
- **WHEN** Bob moves his copy to the trash
- **THEN** Bob's server MUST mark the share declined and send `SHARE_DECLINED` to Alice's instance
- **AND** Alice's share MUST show as declined, and her later changes MUST NOT be sent to Bob

#### Scenario: Bob declines a pending share

- **GIVEN** a pending federated share from Alice under Bob's "Incoming from other organisations"
- **WHEN** Bob declines it
- **THEN** Bob's server MUST send `SHARE_DECLINED` to Alice's instance
- **AND** Alice's share MUST show as declined at once and MUST NOT be retried

#### Scenario: Bob restores his copy

- **GIVEN** a copy Bob moved to the trash, whose share is declined on both sides
- **WHEN** Bob restores the copy from the trash
- **THEN** Bob's server MUST send `SHARE_ACCEPTED` to Alice's instance and mark the share accepted again
- **AND** Alice's share MUST leave "declined" and her later changes MUST reach Bob
- **AND** Bob's copy MUST show Alice's current value

#### Scenario: The owner revoked the share meanwhile

- **GIVEN** a copy Bob moved to the trash, and Alice revoked the share afterwards
- **WHEN** Bob restores the copy from the trash
- **THEN** the copy MUST come back read-only with the value it had
- **AND** the restore MUST tell Bob that the share has ended
- **AND** Alice's share MUST stay revoked
