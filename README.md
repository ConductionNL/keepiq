---

Securely store and share secrets (passwords, API keys, certificates) for Nextcloud users and applications, using end-to-end RSA/AES encryption backed by a private Certificate Authority.

> **Thick backend architecture** — Keepiq owns its own encrypted database tables. No OpenRegister dependency. All secrets are encrypted at rest with RSA-4096 public keys; private keys are AES-256 wrapped with a master password derived key.

## Screenshots

_Add screenshots here once the app has a UI._

## Features

Features are defined in [`openspec/specs/`](openspec/specs/). See the [roadmap](openspec/ROADMAP.md) for planned work. See [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md) for the full competitive analysis and feature matrix.

### Core
- **Encrypted vault** — RSA-4096 + AES-256 encryption with a private Certificate Authority
- **Secret management** — Store passwords, API keys, SSH keys, certificates, and notes
- **Sharing** — Share with Nextcloud users/groups, password-protected links, secret requests
- **Application management** — CSR-based registration, write-without-read for application secrets
- **Key generator** — Configurable password generation with strength feedback

### Supporting
- **Lock screen** — Full-page master password entry with session timeout
- **Admin settings** — CA health, password policies, application approval queue
- **NL Design System** — Government theming support, WCAG AA compliance
- **Quality pipeline** — PHPCS, PHPMD, Psalm, PHPStan, ESLint, Stylelint

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Nextcloud | 28 – 33 |
| PHP | 8.1+ |
| Node.js | 20+ |

## Installation

### From the Nextcloud App Store

1. Go to **Apps** in your Nextcloud instance
2. Search for **Keepiq**
3. Click **Download and enable**

### From Source

```bash
cd /var/www/html/custom_apps
git clone https://github.com/ConductionNL/keepiq.git keepiq
cd keepiq
npm install && npm run build
php occ app:enable keepiq
```

## Development

### Start the environment

Requires a sibling checkout of [openregister](https://github.com/ConductionNL/openregister)
next to this repo (`../openregister`) — Keepiq builds on OpenRegister's AppHost engine.

```bash
composer install && npm install && npm run build
docker compose up -d
```

Nextcloud is served at http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin). Both `openregister`
and `keepiq` are enabled automatically on every container start by the
`before-starting` hook in `docker/nextcloud/enable-apps.sh`.

### Frontend development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Watch mode
npm run build      # Production build
```

### Code quality

```bash
# PHP
composer check:strict   # All quality checks (PHPCS, PHPMD, Psalm, PHPStan, tests)
composer cs:fix         # Auto-fix PHPCS issues
composer phpmd          # Mess detection
composer phpmetrics     # HTML metrics report

# Frontend
npm run lint            # ESLint
npm run stylelint       # CSS linting
```

### Enable locally

The docker compose stack enables both apps automatically on every start. To
(re-)enable them by hand — e.g. after disabling them, without restarting:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
docker exec nextcloud php occ app:enable openregister
docker exec nextcloud php occ app:enable keepiq
```

## Tech Stack

| Data | PostgreSQL (own encrypted tables) |
| UX | @conduction/nextcloud-vue |
| Quality | PHPCS, PHPMD, Psalm, PHPStan, ESLint, Stylelint |

## Branches

## Standards & Compliance

- **Encryption:** RSA-4096 + AES-256, X.509 PKI, NIST SP 800-57

_Add related apps here as integrations are built._

## Troubleshooting

### App UI is blank after enabling

The `js/` build output is not committed to the repo. Run the frontend build before enabling the app:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```
