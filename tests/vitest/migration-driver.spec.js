 * Tests for the worker-vs-main-thread selection in `src/migration/driver.js`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
 *
 * design.md Decision 2 calls the main-thread fallback REQUIRED: `CryptoKey`
 * structured-cloning into a worker has historically been unreliable across
 * engines, so the driver must feature-detect by attempting the handshake and
 * fall back when it fails. Everything else in this change was covered, but the
 * fallback itself had never executed anywhere — the unit tests mock the driver
 * away, and the live Playwright run took whichever path Chromium supports, which
 * is the worker. So the safety net for the engines that need it most was
 * shipping unexercised.
 *
 * These tests drive all three selection outcomes: no Worker constructor at all,
 * a Worker whose postMessage rejects the CryptoKey clone (DataCloneError), and a
 * Worker that handshakes successfully. The pipeline is stubbed, because what is
 * under test is the SELECTION, not the crypto.
