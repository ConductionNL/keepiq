 * Additional fields survive REAL encryption, with real keys.
 *
 * The store spec mocks `rsaEncrypt` as ENC(<input>), which is fine for asserting
 * which field the members land in but proves nothing about secrecy — the mock's
 * "ciphertext" contains its own plaintext. This spec uses the actual RSA-4096-OAEP
 * path so two claims can be made honestly:
 *
 *   1. what was typed is what decrypts (the acceptance criterion), and
 *   2. the ciphertext really does not carry the member names or values in the clear.
 *
 * The member NAMES matter as much as the values here. They are inside the blob by
 * design, precisely so a server cannot learn that a secret has a `recovery-codes`
 * field — the existence of the field is itself information.
