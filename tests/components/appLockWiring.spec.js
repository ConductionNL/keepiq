 * Proves App.vue is actually WIRED to handleLockTransition.
 *
 * guards.spec.js tests the helper's decisions in isolation, which leaves the
 * other half untested: that anything calls it. A refactor dropping the watcher
 * — or renaming `isLocked` — passes every one of those tests while the vault
 * inventory stays on screen after an idle auto-lock.
 *
 * That gap is the exact shape of the bug this whole change fixes: a
 * lifecycle-driven redirect that worked in the eventual state, with no test on
 * the thing that triggers it. So the wiring is asserted, not described.
 *
 * The watcher is invoked directly off the component's options object with a
 * stubbed `this`. Mounting the shell would drag in CnAppRoot, the settings
 * dialog and every store, and would test the framework rather than the wiring.
