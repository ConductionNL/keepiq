/**
 * Database-backed tests for SecretRequestMapper's conditional transition.
 *
 * The only test in this suite that talks to a real database, and deliberately so.
 * `transitionIfPending()` exists to make one guarantee — that a row which stopped
 * being `pending` cannot be overwritten — and that guarantee lives entirely in the
 * SQL. A mocked IQueryBuilder would execute the method and assert on the arguments
 * its own mock received: it would pass just as happily against `update ... where id
 * = ?` with no status guard, which is precisely the defect this method was written
 * to remove. Such a test measures nothing and moves a coverage number, so it is
 * worse than no test.
 *
 * This began as a throwaway probe run against the dev instance while fixing the
 * bug. Review on PR #293 pointed out, correctly, that a guarantee proven by a
 * script nobody runs again is not proven at all.
