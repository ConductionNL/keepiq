/**
 * Pins the observability block that OpenRegister's AppHost engine reads at
 * request time to serve /api/health and /api/metrics.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS.
 *
 * The scenarios in openspec/specs/apphost-adoption/spec.md were waived with
 * "@e2e exclude API-only endpoint — covered by the OR AppHost Newman contract
 * collection". That collection is real and correct, but it lives in the
 * OPENREGISTER repository and keepiq's CI never executes it, so nothing in
 * this repo asserted the contract. The observable HTTP surface is now covered
 * by tests/integration/keepiq.postman_collection.json folder 0, which runs in
 * keepiq's own CI (enable-newman: true).
 *
 * One property cannot be asserted from that HTTP surface: that the
 * suites_total gauge EXCLUDES non-active suites. Both the dev instance and a
 * fresh CI instance contain only active rows, so an equality assertion over
 * the API would pass whether or not the status filter existed — it would
 * measure the fixture, not the filter. That property is therefore asserted
 * here, against the descriptor that drives the generated query.
 *
 * This test pins CONFIGURATION, not engine behaviour. Executing the query is
 * OpenRegister's responsibility and is tested there.
