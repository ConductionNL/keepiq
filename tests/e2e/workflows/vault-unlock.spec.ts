 *
 * DEEP workflow — Vault unlock (high value).
 *
 * Drives the master-password lock screen and asserts the parts of the unlock
 * surface that genuinely work, while honestly flagging the parts that don't.
 *
 * LIVE FINDINGS (verified 2026-06-10 — these are the high-value coverage facts):
 *
 *   1. The instance is NOT in setup mode. The `SeedDevelopmentData` install
 *      repair step provisioned an active EncryptionSuite for admin, so the lock
 *      screen renders the UNLOCK form (one password field, "Unlock Keepiq"),
 *      never the first-time setup form.
 *
 *   2. The seeded suite CANNOT be unlocked headlessly — and, in fact, not at
 *      all. The suite's AES-GCM private-key envelope was written by the PHP
 *      EncryptService with the dev master password `Oj`, but the browser's
 *      decryptPrivateKey() (PBKDF2-SHA256 600k → AES-256-GCM, envelope v1)
 *      rejects it with OperationError for `Oj` AND for any other password.
 *      i.e. the PHP-written envelope is INCOMPATIBLE with the JS envelope
 *      format, so no master password unlocks the seeded vault. Captured as
 *      test.fixme (bug #5 in the report).
 *
 *   3. A failed unlock does NOT surface an error to the UI. Entering a wrong
 *      (or the dev) password — which provably fails to decrypt — leaves the
 *      lock screen with NO "Wrong master password or decryption failed" note,
 *      even after >12s. handleUnlock()'s catch block sets `this.error`, but the
 *      note never renders. Captured as test.fixme (bug #6).
 *
 * The data-INDEPENDENT lock-screen surface (render + route gating + button
 * enable/disable) IS solid and is asserted as the real green coverage here.

	 * Regression guard for the "lock screen is a redirect, not a gate" bug.
