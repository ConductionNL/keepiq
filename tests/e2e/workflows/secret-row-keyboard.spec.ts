 * Workflow — a secret row in the vault list is keyboard-operable (WCAG 2.1 AA
 * SC 2.1.1 Keyboard + 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value; ADR-010).
 *
 * GOAL: prove a keyboard-only user can Tab onto a secret row and open its
 * detail view with Enter (and that Space also activates it), with no mouse
 * events, and that a visible :focus-visible outline is rendered — matching the
 * mouse-click behaviour proven in secret-crud-encryption.spec.ts.
 *
 * Requires a live, seeded Doriath instance (the dev seed ships secrets such as
 * "GitHub"). The vault is unlocked headlessly via the dev master password.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FILE-LEVEL ANCHOR THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS DANGLING. It pointed at
 * `openspec/specs/secrets-write-ui/spec.md#secret-list-rows-must-be-keyboard-operable`
 * (the sigil is omitted on purpose: a literal tag written in prose is parsed by
 * gate-19 exactly like a real one, so quoting a broken anchor re-creates it)
 * and named a scenario that does not exist — the requirement HEADING is called that,
 * the scenarios under it are not. gate-19 reports nothing for a dangling anchor,
 * so these three passing tests were credited to zero scenarios while four real
 * ones sat in its findings list. Anchors are now per-test, against the real
 * slugs, so each claim is checkable against the body directly below it.
