 * Single source of truth for the Nextcloud instance the e2e suite targets.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Specs used to compute the target themselves and fall back to
 * `http://localhost:8080` — the SHARED dev container. `doriath-coverage.spec.ts`
 * did it with absolute literals in its WRITE paths: it created an OCS user,
 * drove a real LOGIN form and then deleted the user, so every local run fired
 * account provisioning and failed logins (brute-force throttling) into an
 * instance other people were working in. String-grepping for `localhost:8080`
 * is not enough on its own either — the same bug has been written with
 * structured `{ hostname: 'localhost', port: 8080 }` fields.
 *
 * Rules encoded here:
 *   - NO `?? 'http://localhost:8080'` fallback. An unset target is a hard
 *     error, not a silent redirect onto somebody else's instance.
 *   - CI's name is accepted. The shared quality workflow exports the target as
 *     `BASE_URL`, `NEXTCLOUD_URL` and `NC_BASE_URL` — not `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`.
 *     A resolver that accepts only the latter hard-fails every CI run (this is
 *     what happened to openconnector). All four names are therefore accepted;
 *     `NC_BASE_URL` was the one missing here.
 *   - One module, so absolute and relative navigation inside one spec cannot
 *     disagree about which instance they mean.
