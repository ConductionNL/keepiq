# Provision a freshly installed Nextcloud so Doriath's e2e suite can run, for
# the shared `E2E Tests (Playwright)` CI job.
#
# Wired up as the workflow's `playwright-seed-command`. That step runs AFTER
# `php -S` is up and with cwd set to the Nextcloud SERVER ROOT, so this is
# invoked as:
#
#     playwright-seed-command: 'bash apps/doriath/tests/e2e/ci-seed.sh'
#
# WHAT DORIATH ACTUALLY NEEDS (and why `occ app:enable` is not enough)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Doriath is a zero-knowledge vault. Nine of its fifteen e2e spec files live in
# tests/e2e/workflows/ and DRIVE the vault: they unlock it with a known
# development master password and then exercise secret CRUD, folders, sharing,
# import, health and audit. That only works when the admin account owns an
# EncryptionSuite whose AES-GCM private-key envelope was written with that
# password — which is what `lib/Repair/SeedDevelopmentData.php` creates.
#
# But `SeedDevelopmentData::run()` opens with:
#
#     if ($this->config->getSystemValueBool('debug', false) === false) { return; }
#
# and the shared workflow installs Nextcloud with `occ maintenance:install`,
# which leaves `debug` at its default of FALSE. So on a stock CI install the
# repair step runs, returns immediately, seeds nothing, and exits 0. The app
# enables cleanly, the SPA boots, and the vault sits in first-time-setup mode.
# The failure mode is a wall of workflow specs timing out on
# `expect('.lock-screen').toHaveCount(0)` — messages that accuse the unlock flow
# and are really an unprovisioned instance. (The same shape was observed on an
# isolated dev instance: 35 of 56 specs failed this way before `debug` was set;
# see the header of tests/e2e/workflows/_workflow-helpers.ts.)
#
# The generic `IRepairStep` trap applies on top of that: a repair step runs with
# NO user session, `InitializeSettings::run()` catches `\Throwable` and
# downgrades it to `$output->warning(...)`, and `occ app:enable` still exits 0.
# So nothing in the install path is load-bearing evidence that provisioning
# happened.
#
# This script therefore does the provisioning EXPLICITLY and then VERIFIES it, so
# a bad provision is ONE loud step failure here instead of ~20 misleading spec
# failures later. It is idempotent: every step either no-ops or re-verifies.

# enough on its own — repair steps only run during install/upgrade — so the app
# is disabled and re-enabled, which takes `Installer::installApp()` →
# `installAppLastSteps()` and executes both the `post-migration` and the
# `install` repair-step lists again (verified against nextcloud/server:
# lib/private/Installer.php:533-570 — `install` steps run unconditionally,
# `post-migration` steps run whenever `installed_version` is already set).
#
# Every seeder is idempotent (SeedDevelopmentData returns early when admin
# already owns a key-pair-consistent suite; SeedSecretTypes upserts by name), so
# running them twice is harmless.

# ── 2. Import the Doriath register into OpenRegister ─────────────────────────
# Doriath adopts OpenRegister's AppHost engine (lib/AppInfo/Application.php,
# ADR-040 / ADR-022) and ships lib/Settings/doriath_register.json.
# `InitializeSettings` imports it with `force: false`, the version-guarded path,
# which can advance the recorded configuration version WITHOUT applying
# anything. Doriath has no `settings#import` route of its own (appinfo/routes.php
# registers only getAdminSettings / updateAdminSettings / getUserSettings /
# updateUserSettings / getPolicy), so use OpenRegister's generic importer.
#
# That endpoint accepts exactly three input shapes — a multipart file under the
# literal key `file`, a `url` param, or a `json` param. The raw register JSON as
# the request body is NOT one of them (it 400s with "Missing required keys").
# `force` is compared `=== 'true' || === true`, so the multipart string "true"
# is accepted here.
#
# lib/Settings/register.d/ is the ADR-037 fragment directory. It currently holds
# only README.md; if fragments are ever added they must each be posted
# separately (the importer rejects multi-file uploads with "Expected only 1
# file"), so the loop below is written to handle that already.
