 * Gate-19 spec-coverage — Doriath gated routes (Dashboard, Vault, Features &
 * roadmap, Secret detail).
 *
 * When the vault is locked, the router guard redirects every in-app route to
 * the lock screen with a returnUrl. This is the observable, data-independent UI
 * contract for these routes for a locked user. (Reaching the rendered views
 * requires the master password, which is — by design — unrecoverable, so the
 * redirect behaviour is what we assert.)
