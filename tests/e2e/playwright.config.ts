 * CI regression config for the shared `E2E Tests (Playwright)` job.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND CONFIG EXISTS
 * --------------------------
 * The shared workflow (ConductionNL/.github/.github/workflows/quality.yml)
 * runs the suite as:
 *
 *     CONFIG="${{ inputs.playwright-test-path }}/playwright.config.ts"
 *     if [ ! -f "$CONFIG" ] && [ -f "playwright.config.ts" ]; then
 *       CONFIG="playwright.config.ts"
 *     fi
 *     npx playwright test --config="$CONFIG"
 *
 * Note what is missing: `--project`. So whichever config it picks, EVERY
 * project in it runs. The root `playwright.config.ts` declares two:
 *
 *   chromium — the spec-coverage + workflow regression suite. CI wants this.
 *   visual   — pixel-diff baselines. Its own header states the PNGs are
 *              host-font/GPU specific and "a CI Linux runner will not
 *              byte-match a dev-container baseline", so it cannot pass here.
 *
 * Letting the root config be picked therefore runs a project that is
 * documented as unable to pass on a CI runner. Rather than delete or weaken
 * it, `playwright-test-path: tests/e2e` in the caller makes the workflow's
 * FIRST lookup hit this file, which declares only the regression project. The
 * root config is untouched and stays the entry point for local runs and
 * `--project visual`.
 *
 * The report/output paths also differ deliberately: the workflow uploads
 * `server/apps/<app>/playwright-report/` and `server/apps/<app>/test-results/`,
 * so on CI the artifacts must land at the APP ROOT, not under `tests/e2e/`.
 * With the root config's paths the "Upload Playwright report" step matches
 * nothing and silently uploads an empty artifact (`if-no-files-found: ignore`)
 * — a failing run with no report to read.
