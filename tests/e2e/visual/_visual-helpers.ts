 * Shared helpers for the visual-regression layer (GAP-5).
 *
 * This module is intentionally self-contained (imports only @playwright/test)
 * and is copied verbatim into each app's tests/e2e/visual/ directory so every
 * app's visual suite is identical and portable.
 *
 * Determinism is the whole point of a visual baseline: a flaky baseline is
 * worse than none. Every shot is taken with:
 *   - a fixed 1280x800 viewport (set on the `visual` project in the config),
 *   - CSS animations / transitions / caret blink disabled,
 *   - the auto-opening cn-support-dialog dismissed + hidden,
 *   - dynamic regions masked (dates, ids, avatars, counts, relative times),
 *   - a wait for *content* (no spinners / skeletons) before the shot,
 *   - maxDiffPixelRatio tolerance to absorb sub-pixel font hinting.
 *
 * PLATFORM CAVEAT (read before trusting a CI run): Playwright screenshot
 * baselines are rendered by the host's font stack + GPU, so a baseline shot on
 * a dev workstation will NOT byte-match the same page rendered on a CI Linux
 * runner. Baselines committed here are generated against the local dev
 * container. In CI the visual project must therefore either (a) regenerate its
 * own baselines on first run, or (b) stay non-gating until baselined in the CI
 * environment. See tests/e2e/visual/README in-repo wiring notes.

/**
 * Assert that the component under test is ACTUALLY ON SCREEN, then shoot it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — READ BEFORE ADDING A BASELINE
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * `shootSurface` above proves only that *a* page rendered. Nextcloud draws its
 * header, its left navigation and the app shell for every route, including the
 * ones that redirected somewhere else — so a screenshot named
 * `password-health.png` taken after a silent bounce to the lock screen is a
 * perfectly stable, perfectly green baseline of the wrong screen. Gate-26
 * cannot tell the difference: it only looks for the component's NAME somewhere
 * under `tests/e2e/visual/**`, and the name is in the filename either way.
 * Confirmed on this repo: a two-line file whose entire content was a COMMENT
 * naming one view took gate-26 from 10 findings to 9 — no screenshot, no
 * navigation, not even valid test code. The same trap in widget form is
 * recorded fleet-wide: asserting a `type:"data"` widget's TITLE tests the
 * manifest, not the render.
 *
 * ⚠️ Which is why the view is NOT named here. Writing the component's name into
 * this comment would itself satisfy gate-26 for that component — the corpus this
 * gate reads is the raw text of every file under `tests/e2e/visual/**`, comments
 * included, and this file is one of them. An earlier draft of this paragraph did
 * exactly that, and the negative control caught it: with the real specs moved
 * away the gate reported 7 uncovered components instead of 8, the missing one
 * being the view this sentence used to name. Document the defect without
 * spelling the token.
 *
 * So every baseline in this app goes through here, and every one of them names
 * a `data-testid` that ONLY the component under test renders. If we landed on
 * the lock screen, or on the dashboard, or on an error page, the `expect`
 * below fails and no screenshot is written — instead of a green baseline of
 * app chrome.
 *
 * @param page       The Playwright page, already navigated to the surface.
 * @param testId     A `data-testid` rendered ONLY by the component under test.
 * @param name       The baseline filename.
