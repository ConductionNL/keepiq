 * The root ("All secrets") shows NO vault rows (2026-09-03, per Remko,
 * after comparing with Proton Pass): it is a cross-vault query, not a
 * container the user is inside, so vault rows there were navigation posing
 * as contents — duplicating the nav's folder tree one panel away and
 * pushing every secret below a screen of vaults, worst on mobile where the
 * nav toggle already opens the vault list in one tap. Inside a folder the
 * rows stay: there they ARE the contents of the thing being looked at.
 *
 * Options-object style (like SecretList.registryDispatch.spec.js).
