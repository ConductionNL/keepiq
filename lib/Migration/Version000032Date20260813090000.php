/**
 * Keepiq Migration - Per-record migration failure accounting
 *
 * Adds `doriath_migration_failures`: one row per RECORD that a
 * compromise-recovery migration could not carry across.
 *
 * Before this, the single `migration_error` column on `doriath_secrets` was
 * the accounting flag for the secret head PLUS every one of its versions and
 * attachment grants — up to `1 + N + M` independent records sharing one slot.
 * Three consequences, all key-loss or denial-of-termination:
 *
 *   - A version or grant whose secret head had already migrated was invisible
 *     to both completion gates: the unaccounted queries excluded it (its
 *     secret carried an error) while `findFailedBySuiteForOwner` did not
 *     return it (its secret was on the NEW suite), so the migration
 *     terminated and locked the old suite over readable-but-unmigrated rows.
 *   - Committing any sibling record cleared the column, erasing a failure
 *     that had already been recorded.
 *   - The acknowledgement compared a client-side per-RECORD count against a
 *     server-side distinct-SECRET count, so "Finish anyway" could never be
 *     satisfied and the vault stayed write-locked.
 *
 * Failures are scoped to a migration_id and deleted with it, so this table
 * holds only in-flight accounting and never grows unbounded. The unique index
 * over (migration_id, store, record_id) is what makes a retry idempotent
 * rather than accumulating a second entry for the same record.
