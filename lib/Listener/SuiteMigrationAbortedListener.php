/**
 * Keepiq Suite Migration Aborted Listener
 *
 * Responds to a compromise-recovery migration being aborted by releasing the
 * SecretRequests that SuiteMigrationStartedListener locked when the migration
 * began — keeping them on the OLD suite, because an abort returns the vault to
 * that suite rather than migrating to the new one.
 *
 * This is deliberately the ONLY reaction to an abort. The completion listeners
 * (compromise-flagging, link-share revocation, emergency-access invalidation)
 * must not run: nothing was migrated, the old suite stays active, and firing
 * them would tear down state the abort exists to preserve.
