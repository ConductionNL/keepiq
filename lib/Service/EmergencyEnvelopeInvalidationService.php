/**
 * Keepiq Emergency Envelope Invalidation Service
 *
 * Envelope invalidation on key change (add-emergency-access): when a
 * grantor's or grantee's encryption suite is rotated or revoked, the
 * grantee-encrypted recovery envelopes that escrow the now-stale key must
 * stop being usable.
 *
 * On a grantor ROTATION (compromise recovery) the envelope is now MIGRATED
 * rather than invalidated wherever the grantee is still reachable: the browser
 * mints a fresh envelope escrowing the new private key and re-points the
 * contact through reEnvelopeForRotation(). invalidateForGrantorRotation() then
 * runs at completion as a residual SWEEP, catching only the contacts the loop
 * could not carry (grantee has no active suite). Revocation of the grantor's
 * suite still DELETES the envelopes outright, because it produces no new key to
 * migrate to.
