/**
 * Doriath Migration Work Service
 *
 * The per-record half of compromise-recovery migration: what is still bound
 * to the old suite, and the guarded commit of one re-encrypted record.
 *
 * The server never decrypts and never encrypts here (ADR-003). Every method
 * takes ciphertext the browser produced and verified, and its whole job is to
 * refuse the write unless the row is one this migration is entitled to touch.

/**
 * Outstanding-work discovery and guarded per-record commits for a migration.
 *
 * @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.CouplingBetweenObjects)   The service exists to hold
 *   one discipline across all three ciphertext-bearing stores, so it
 *   necessarily reaches their three mappers, their three entities and the two
 *   guard exceptions. Splitting it per store would give each store its own copy
 *   of the two-part authorization guard — which is exactly the drift this class
 *   prevents.
 * @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.ExcessiveClassComplexity) The complexity is three
 *   near-parallel guard/commit pairs, not tangled logic. Collapsing them behind
 *   one generic entry point would mean passing the store as a parameter on a
 *   per-object write path, which the change's design rejected as an IDOR
 *   footgun (hydra-gate-no-admin-idor).
