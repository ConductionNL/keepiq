/**
 * Main application class for the Doriath Nextcloud app.
 *
 * This class is the composition root and little else. The wiring itself lives
 * in single-purpose registrars in this namespace, each of which owns one
 * domain's bindings and can be unit-tested on its own — `Application` cannot
 * be constructed without a Nextcloud DI container, so anything written inline
 * here is unreachable from a test.
 *
 * The registrars are plain collaborators instantiated with `new` rather than
 * resolved from the container: `register()` IS the point at which the
 * container is being populated, so there is nothing to resolve from yet.
 *
 * The AppHost adoption below deliberately stays inline. It is the one piece
 * of wiring that references a class from a SIBLING app, which psalm cannot
 * resolve; moved into a registrar of its own, its `$context`/`$appId`
 * parameters would be reachable only from that unresolvable call and psalm
 * reports both as never referenced (measured).

		// Adopt the OpenRegister AppHost engine (ADR-040 / ADR-022). One call wires
		// the boilerplate plumbing the fleet shares: the dashboard/preferences/
		// settings controllers, the settings + action-auth services, the install
		// repair steps, the admin-settings panel + section, the manifest-driven
		// deep-link listener, and the observability controllers (health + metrics).
		//
		// Every registration is a lazy service closure, so a disabled/absent
		// OpenRegister never fatals Nextcloud bootstrap — an aliased route simply
		// surfaces a 5xx and /api/health reports the degraded state.
		//
		// Doriath then RE-REGISTERS its three domain-divergent plumbing classes
		// after this call so the concrete leaf classes win over the generic
		// aliases (see DomainOverrideRegistrar).
		//
		// LOAD-ORDER HAZARD (measured, not theoretical). OC_App::getEnabledApps()
		// sort()s the app list, and Coordinator::registerApps() walks THAT sorted
		// list calling OC_App::registerAutoloading($appId) and then $app->register()
		// for one app at a time. So every app registers before the PSR-4 prefix of
		// every alphabetically-LATER app exists: `doriath` < `openregister`, so
		// OCA\OpenRegister\ is not autoloadable at this point on a perfectly
		// healthy instance.
		//
		// Left unguarded, the resulting \Error aborted this ENTIRE register() —
		// every registrar below never ran, and the audit listener recorded ZERO
		// dispatched events. Coordinator::registerApps() catches the Throwable and
		// logs an 'emergency', then `continue`s to the next app, so Doriath stayed
		// enabled and kept serving requests: nothing in the UI, and nothing in the
		// app itself, reported that half its wiring was missing.
		//
		// OpenRegisterAutoloader::register() puts OpenRegister's prefix on the
		// autoloader ourselves, which is exactly what Nextcloud will do a few
		// iterations later. It never throws; it returns false when OpenRegister is
		// absent, and the class_exists() guard below then skips the AppHost
		// plumbing.
		OpenRegisterAutoloader::register();
