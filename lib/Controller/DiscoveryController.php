/**
 * Keepiq Machine API Discovery Controller
 *
 * Serves the unauthenticated, machine-readable discovery document at
 * `GET /api/v1/app/.well-known/keepiq`, and at the pre-rename
 * `.well-known/doriath` until that path is retired. A consumer configures one base
 * URL plus its application id and private key, fetches this document, and
 * derives every contract URL (token endpoint, grant type, assertion
 * requirements, secret endpoints, envelope formats) without reading
 * Keepiq source. The document carries no instance-private data.
 *
 * BOTH PATHS ARE SERVED, and the pre-rename one is not going away yet. This
 * is the one URL a machine consumer is configured with by hand — everything
 * else it uses is derived from the document this endpoint returns — so moving
 * it would break every configured consumer at once. Serving both instead is
 * additive: the document names the canonical path in `discoveryPath`, so a
 * consumer re-points itself without anyone coordinating a change window, and
 * `deprecatedDiscoveryPaths[].removedInAppVersion` says when the old one
 * stops. Every hit on it is logged so the migration is observable.
 *
 * The old path retires at Application::PRE_STABLE_COMPAT_REMOVED_IN, together
 * with the `doriath-machine-secret-v1` envelope name and the `aud=doriath`
 * claim — not at a future apiVersion. Nothing stable has shipped, so there is
 * no released contract a version bump would protect; PreStableCompatDeadlineTest
 * fails the build if any of the three outlives that version.
