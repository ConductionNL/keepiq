/**
 * Keepiq Migrate App Config Keys Repair Step
 *
 * Repair step that carries this app's stored `IAppConfig` values across the
 * `doriath` -> `keepiq` app-id rename.
 *
 * Nextcloud namespaces `IAppConfig` by app id at the storage layer
 * (`oc_appconfig.appid`), so renaming `<id>` does not rename the rows — it
 * makes every previously stored value unreachable, because the app now asks
 * for them under a different app id. There is no in-place app-id upgrade in
 * Nextcloud: the new id is simply a different app. This step therefore copies
 * each value from the old namespace to the new one.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS PARTICULARLY HERE. This app is a secrets vault, and several
 * of the copied keys are security floors rather than conveniences:
 * `master_password_min_length`, `master_password_min_score`,
 * `min_zxcvbn_score`, `block_on_hibp_hit` and `policy_exempt_types` are the
 * org password policy; `ca_status` is the certificate authority's health
 * marker; `audit_retention_days` decides how long the audit trail is kept.
 * Losing them does not error — every reader carries a default, so the instance
 * silently reverts to the shipped floor. An admin who RAISED a floor would
 * have it quietly lowered again.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STEP DOES NOT TOUCH. No secret, key or certificate is moved here:
 * the vault lives in this app's own tables (`doriath_secrets`,
 * `doriath_enc_suites`, `doriath_ca_certs`, …), whose names deliberately keep
 * the old prefix precisely so that no rename can orphan them. See the comment
 * in `appinfo/info.xml`.
 *
 * WHY EVERY KEY RATHER THAN A FIXED LIST. `AdminSettingsService` writes its
 * admin keys from a defaults map, but that is not the whole stored set —
 * `ComplianceReportService` caches metrics under `compliance_metrics_*`,
 * `CertificateAuthorityService` writes `ca_status`, and past releases have
 * written keys this app no longer reads. Enumerating `IAppConfig::getKeys()`
 * is exhaustive by construction and cannot drift out of date the way a
 * hardcoded list does.
 *
 * SAFETY. Idempotent and non-destructive:
 *   - a key is copied only when the old value is non-empty AND the new
 *     namespace does not already hold a value, so an admin edit made after the
 *     rename is never clobbered and a second run is a no-op;
 *   - the old `doriath` rows are never deleted, so a rollback to the previous
 *     app id still finds its configuration intact;
 *   - values round-trip as raw strings. `IAppConfig` stores every value as a
 *     string and the typed accessors only coerce on read, so a string
 *     round-trip cannot lose or corrupt a value written by a typed setter;
 *   - every failure is logged and the loop continues. A repair step that
 *     throws aborts the install, and a config value that could not be copied
 *     is not worth failing an install over — the app falls back to its
 *     defaults and the admin can re-enter the setting.
 *
 * Registered under BOTH `<install>` and `<post-migration>` in
 * `appinfo/info.xml`, and before `BootstrapCertificateAuthority` and
 * `InitializeSettings` in both — see the ordering comment there.
