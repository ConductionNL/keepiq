/**
 * Keepiq Migrate User Preferences Repair Step
 *
 * Repair step that carries this app's per-user preferences across the
 * `doriath` -> `keepiq` app-id rename.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM MigrateAppConfigKeys. `IAppConfig` and
 * `IConfig`'s user values are different stores: the former is `oc_appconfig`,
 * the latter `oc_preferences`. Both are namespaced by app id, so both are cut
 * off by the rename, but copying one does nothing for the other.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. Every reader of these preferences carries
 * a DEFAULT, so a lost value does not error — it reverts, silently, with no
 * log line to notice. The consequences here are user-visible and, in two
 * cases, privacy-relevant:
 *   - `NotificationService::isOptedOut()` reads `notify_shares`,
 *     `notify_requests`, `notify_group_shares` and `notify_security` with a
 *     default of `'1'`. A user who explicitly turned a category OFF has `'0'`
 *     stored under the OLD app id; after the rename the lookup finds nothing
 *     and that user starts receiving the notifications they opted out of.
 *   - `breach_check_opt_in` defaults to `'0'`, so it fails safe — but
 *     `offline_cache_optin` defaults to `'1'`, which means a user who opted
 *     OUT of caching vault contents on a shared device silently gets the
 *     offline cache back.
 *   - `session_timeout` reverts to the instance default, which can LENGTHEN
 *     the unlocked-vault window for a user who deliberately shortened it.
 *
 * WHY IT ENUMERATES BY USER RATHER THAN BY VALUE. The planninq pilot walked
 * `IConfig::getUsersForUserValue(app, key, value)` for each of a boolean key's
 * two possible values. That is exhaustive only for closed value sets, and this
 * app does not have one: `session_timeout` and `expiry_max_age_days` hold
 * arbitrary numeric strings and `default_secret_type` holds a secret-type slug
 * that admins can add to at runtime, so no finite value list can be written
 * down. Enumerating users instead and asking `IConfig::getUserKeys()` what
 * that user actually stored is exhaustive by construction, for open and closed
 * value sets alike, and — like MigrateAppConfigKeys' use of `getKeys()` —
 * cannot drift when a future release adds a preference.
 *
 * `callForSeenUsers()` rather than `callForAllUsers()`: a stored preference is
 * written from the app's own settings UI, which requires a login, so a user
 * with something in `oc_preferences` for this app has necessarily been seen.
 * The seen-user walk reads the same table and avoids a full backend
 * enumeration (LDAP included) on every install.
 *
 * SAFETY. Idempotent and non-destructive, matching MigrateAppConfigKeys:
 *   - a value is copied only when the user has nothing stored under the new
 *     app id, so a preference changed after the rename is never clobbered and
 *     a second run is a no-op;
 *   - the old `doriath` rows are never deleted, so a rollback still finds them;
 *   - every failure is logged and the loop continues, because one unreadable
 *     preference is not worth aborting an install over.
 *
 * NO KEY MATERIAL PASSES THROUGH HERE. `oc_preferences` holds this app's
 * user-facing toggles only. Master passwords are never stored at all
 * (ADR-003), and the per-user RSA key pairs live wrapped in the
 * `doriath_enc_suites` table, which the rename does not touch.
 *
 * Registered under BOTH `<install>` and `<post-migration>` in
 * `appinfo/info.xml` alongside MigrateAppConfigKeys — see the ordering comment
 * there. No other repair step reads or writes user values, so this one has no
 * ordering constraint of its own beyond running before anything that might.
