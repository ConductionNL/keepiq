/**
 * Provenance-keyed access to ShareTarget rows.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND MAPPER OVER ONE TABLE.
 *
 * A row in `doriath_share_targets` is one recipient's encrypted copy of one
 * source secret, and it is reached in two quite different ways. Most callers
 * ask about the row itself — by id, by source secret, by target user, by
 * recipient secret copy. Four callers instead ask about the GRANT that created
 * a whole fan-out of rows: `group_share_id` and `team_folder_id` are foreign
 * keys to the bulk-grant records that the GroupShareService and the
 * TeamFolder* services own, and every query on them is a cascade — "which rows
 * did this grant produce, so they can be listed or revoked together".
 *
 * Those two responsibilities were both public API on `ShareTargetMapper`,
 * which is how it reached twelve public methods. Splitting on provenance keeps
 * each mapper's callers coherent (the bulk-grant services talk only to this
 * one; the per-target services never do) and is the only cut available that
 * does not merge two intentions behind a flag argument.
 *
 * The shared table name is deliberate and not a smell: both mappers project
 * the same entity, and QBMapper's contract is (connection, table, entity) —
 * nothing about it says one table may have only one mapper.
 *
