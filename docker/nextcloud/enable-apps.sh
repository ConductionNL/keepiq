# before-starting hook for the official nextcloud image: runs as www-data on
# every container start, after install/upgrade and before Apache. A previous
# attempt used `entrypoint: occ app:enable ...`, which replaces the image's
# entrypoint entirely and prevents Nextcloud from starting — hence this hook.
#
# app:enable is idempotent, so re-running on every start is harmless.
# openregister must be enabled first: doriath builds on its AppHost engine.
