 * Vault navigation guard.
 *
 * The encryption-suites spec requires that when the in-memory CryptoKey is
 * absent, "any Keepiq route" access redirects to the lock screen, and that
 * the lock screen is a full page rather than an overlay. Enforcing that from
 * a component lifecycle hook is too late: the router has already resolved
 * the route, so `CnPageRenderer` mounts the target page and its `mounted()`
 * fires before any redirect can land. `SecretList` in particular issues
 * `fetchSecrets()` unconditionally on mount, and secret `name` / `url` /
 * folder placement are stored server-side in plaintext by design (see
 * lib/Db/Secret.php) so the vault inventory paints before the lock screen
 * replaces it.
 *
 * This guard runs in `beforeEach`, so a locked vault never resolves a
 * protected route at all — no page component is instantiated and no fetch
 * is issued. It is deliberately synchronous: gating navigation behind an
 * awaited settings request (as the previous App.vue boot redirect did)
 * reopens exactly the window it is meant to close.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT.
 *
 * This is a UI gate, not an authorisation check. Secret `name`, `url` and
 * `folderId` are stored server-side in plaintext by design (searchable for
 * their owner) and `SecretController::index()` authorises on the Nextcloud
 * session alone. There is no server-side notion of "locked" — the master
 * password never leaves the browser and `isLocked` is purely
 * `cryptoKey === null` — so `curl` with a valid session cookie, or a
 * Nextcloud app password, returns the full inventory whether or not any tab
 * has the vault unlocked.
 *
 * What this guard removes is the browser rendering and fetching that
 * inventory: the restored-tab and deep-link cases, where the app itself put
 * the vault on screen before the lock screen replaced it. It adds nothing
 * against a shared session, a stolen cookie or a hostile extension. Gating
 * inventory reads on the master password would need a separate server-side
 * control — e.g. binding them to a short-lived token minted at unlock — and
 * that is not what this is.
 *
 * vue-router 4 note: the `(to, from, next)` signature is still fully
 * supported. It is kept over the newer "return a route location" idiom so
 * the redirect and the pass-through read identically.

 * no-navigation case is precisely what this function exists for. In the

 * reads `manifest.walkthrough` and fetches the tour's completion preference
 * when the shell mounts, before any route resolves. That put

 * lock screen and broke the invariant that a locked vault issues no Keepiq API
 * request at all — the assertion that exists because a lock screen which is a
 * redirect rather than a gate leaks the real inventory.
 *
 * Withheld, not disabled: the shell re-renders when `isLocked` flips, so the
 * tour is offered on the first UNLOCKED visit. A product tour drawn over a
 * locked vault would be the wrong behaviour regardless of the request.
