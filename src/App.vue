  Keepiq app shell — thin CnAppRoot wrapper (hydra ADR-024 / ADR-036).

  CnAppRoot handles the dependency check, manifest-driven CnAppNav,
  and per-route page dispatch (manifest.pages[].type →
  Cn{Dashboard,Settings,Index,Detail,…}Page). For keepiq the dashboard
  is rendered via the v2 widget grid (the manifest's Dashboard page
  carries `widgets[]` targeting the `body` slot, so CnPageRenderer
  short-circuits the default CnDashboardPage component and mounts
  CnWidgetGrid directly — matches the shillinq#166 pattern).

  Keepiq-specific concerns the shell still owns:
  - Pinia stores boot once (settings + object configure against
    OpenRegister).
  - Lock-screen gating: whenever the session locks, redirect to the
    Lock route. When the user navigates to `/lock` while unlocked
    (e.g. via the "Lock vault" footer menu entry), call
    `session.lock()` so the screen renders the unlock form rather
    than bouncing back to Dashboard.
  - Session-timeout polling + visibility/beforeunload key clearing.
  - User-settings dialog: the legacy UserSettings.vue contents are
    injected into CnAppRoot's `#user-settings` slot so the manifest
    entry `action: "user-settings"` opens the same Session / Security
    / Encryption sections the previous MainMenu footer item did.
-->
<template>
	<!-- Public surface: a recipient with no account, holding a fill link.
	     Rendered WITHOUT the app shell, because CnAppRoot's CnAppNav lists every
	     page in the manifest — measured on 2026-08-19, an anonymous recipient was
	     served "Dashboard, Vault, Password health, Certificates, Emergency access,
	     Settings…", none of which they can open. That is the app's whole feature
	     surface disclosed to a stranger, and a row of dead links around the one
	     task they came to do.

	     CnAppRoot hosts `<router-view>` itself, so skipping it means rendering the
	     route here. The library documents this as the supported path for a layout
	     that is not the app shell. `t()` is an app-level mixin from main.js, not a
	     CnAppRoot injection, so public views keep their translations.

	     The offline banner, migration banner, lock-screen gating and user-settings
	     dialog are all deliberately absent: every one of them speaks about a vault
	     the recipient has no account for. -->

		     at this rendered a blank page and logged "[CnPageRenderer] No page found
		     for $route.name". Its props take precedence over inject, so they are
		     supplied here.
