 * Doriath Tier-4 bootstrap (hydra ADR-024 / ADR-036).
 *
 * Builds the vue-router from the bundled manifest, registers lib
 * icons + translations, and mounts the CnAppRoot-driven shell at
 * `#doriath-app`.
 *
 * ⚠️ The host element is `#doriath-app`, NOT `#content`. Under Vue 2,
 * `$mount('#content')` REPLACED the matched element, so the template's
 * `<div id="content">` (a duplicate of core's `layout.user.php` wrapper)
 * was swallowed. Vue 3's `mount()` renders INSIDE the match instead, so
 * mounting on `#content` would nest the app in core's own wrapper. The
 * host element is renamed rather than reasoning about which div wins.
