  Shell-level banner for an interrupted compromise-recovery migration.

  This is the surface for the case nothing else covers: the browser started a
  rotation and never finished it — a closed tab, a crash, a reload — so the
  migration row is still `in_progress`, the vault is still write-locked, and
  without this banner there is nothing anywhere in the UI that says so. The
  completion endpoint is never reached in that state, so the server's gate never
  gets a chance to explain itself either.

  Driven entirely by server state (GET /api/v1/migrations/status plus the derived
  remaining count), because a client-side count died with the tab that produced
  it.
